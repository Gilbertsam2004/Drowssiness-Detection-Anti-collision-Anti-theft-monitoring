# drowssiness-Detection
INFORMATION DATA:
According to a study published in the International Journal of Occupational Safety and Health, 37% of commercial truck drivers in India reported falling asleep while driving, and 70% reported feeling drowsy while driving. Another study conducted by the Indian Sleep Disorders Association found that 20% of road accidents in the country are caused by drowsy driving.
Overall, the data shows that drowsy driving is a significant problem in India, and it contributes to a significant number of road accidents in the country. It is important for drivers to take adequate rest before embarking on long journeys and to pull over and take a break if they feel drowsy while driving.

ABSTRACT:
The main aim of this project is to develop a drowsiness detection system by monitoring the eyes of the driver; it is believed that the symptoms of the driver fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid a car accident.
In case when drowsiness is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver.
This detection system provides a noncontact technique for judging different level of driver alertness and facilities early detection of a decline in alertness in driving.
The following are the problems we are going to tackle in our entire project:

                              1) Driver Drowsiness Detection
                              2) Vehicle Anti Theft Face Recognition System              
                              3) Anti Collision System

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
This system provides USB camera for Eye-Blink Monitoring System and includes a Buzzer to alert the driver when he is drowsy.Once the drowsiness is detected, there is a fixed buzzer inside the car which will alert  the driver until he wakes up.
 NOVELTY:
        A  fixed  display which will be placed in the back side of the car that will be useful to the other vehicle behind the car. If the driver is drowsy, the display will show that the driver of the car is drowsy.At last, we are going to fix a new tail light at the back of the car.
In this process if the driver is drowsy , our new tail light will blink. As far our research is done , this technology has not been created.

VECHILE ANTITHEFT COLLISION:
  The objective of this to create Vehicle anti-theft recognition system that would be practical , secure and innovative.
  So in this I will fix the camera around the car so if the official person comes near the car  it will tends to unlock
  If we implement this on the car it will be the most secured budget smart car
  We have also creating the app to unlock the car once if the face recognition doesn’t work. In this system the morf image cannot be accessed by the car.

Anti Collision System:
  This is an advanced driver assistance system designed to reduce the severity of a collision.
  If the driver is drowsy, our system will  automatically  sense the object Infront of it and applies an  break to the car. 
  This will help to avoid the major accident for the vehicle.

Extra Features:
   Pulse sensor is fixed in the steering wheel which is used to detect the pulse and it will displayed on the dashboard

   When the alcohol gas is present, the sensor's conductivity gets higher along with the gas concentration rising thus indicating its presence in the form of its LED     blinking.

   This process we have introduced that if the alcohol consumption by driver or driver drowsy detection or any other emergency situation the exact location of the car will send to the owner of car via SMS
